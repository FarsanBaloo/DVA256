World War I or The First World War, often abbreviated as WWI or WW1, began on the 28th of July, 1914 and ended on the 11th of November, 1918. Referred to by contemporaries as the "Great War", belligerents included much of Europe, Russia, the United States and Turkey, with fighting also expanding into the Middle East, Africa and parts of Asia. One of the deadliest conflicts in history, an estimated 9 million were killed in combat, while over 5 million civilians died from occupation, bombardment, hunger or disease.[4] Millions of additional deaths resulted from genocides within the Ottoman Empire and the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, which was exacerbated by the movement of combatants during the war.[5][6] By 1914, the European great powers were divided into the Triple Entente of France, Russia, and Britain, and the Triple Alliance, Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy. Tensions in the Balkans came to a head on 28 June 1914 following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the Austro-Hungarian heir, by Gavrilo Princip, a Bosnian Serb. Austria-Hungary blamed Serbia and led to the July Crisis, an unsuccessful attempt to avoid conflict through diplomacy. When Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia on 28 July, Russia came to its defence and by 4 August the system of alliances drew in Germany, France and Britain, along with their respective empires. In November, the Ottoman Empire, Germany and Austria formed the Central Powers, while in April 1915, Italy joined Britain, France, Russia and Serbia as the Allied Powers.
